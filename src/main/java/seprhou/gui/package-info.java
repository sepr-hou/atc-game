/**
 * The gaphical code of the game.
 *
 * <p>This package contains all the GUI and user interaction stuff. You should probably read up on
 * libGDX and the scene2d part of libGDX to know how everything works here. The classes
 * are layed out in a hierarchy roughly as follows.
 *
 * <h4>Main and AtcGame</h4>
 * <p>The {@link seprhou.gui.Main} class controls the game startup and the
 * {@link seprhou.gui.AtcGame} class acts as the top of the game hierarchy.
 * However all this class does is pass on events to be handled by the current screen.
 *
 * <h4>AbstractScreen</h4>
 * <p>The {@link seprhou.gui.AbstractScreen} class manages components common to each
 * screen, the most important being the libGDX {@link com.badlogic.gdx.scenes.scene2d.Stage}.
 * All the events are passed to the stage and are then distributed to whichever objects
 * asked to receive them (like the individual labels or even the whole game area).
 *
 * <h4>Screen implementations</h4>
 * <p>The Screen implementations ({@link seprhou.gui.MenuScreen}, {@link seprhou.gui.GameScreen},
 * {@link seprhou.gui.GameOverScreen}, {@link seprhou.gui.OptionsScreen} and
 * {@link seprhou.gui.HighScoresScreen}) managed their individual screens and the components on them.
 * Most use libGDX scene2d objects to draw labels and buttons on the screen. The only exception is GameArea.
 *
 * <h4>GameArea</h4>
 * <p>Finally the {@link seprhou.gui.GameArea} class handles and renders the game itself.
